## Critical Algorithm Problems

### 1. Branch & Bound Simplex Solver (`BranchAndBoundSimplexSolver.cs`)

**Major Issues**:

#### Incomplete Branching Constraint Implementation
```csharp
// Lines 257-264: Placeholder implementation
private void AddBranchingConstraints(BranchAndBoundNode node)
{
    // For simplicity, we'll modify the existing problem by adding penalty terms
    // In a full implementation, you would extend the constraint matrix
    
    // This is a simplified approach - in practice you'd need to properly
    // add the branching constraints to the problem formulation
}
```
**Impact**: Branching nodes are created but constraints are not properly enforced, leading to incorrect solutions.

#### Incorrect Integer Variable Detection
```csharp
// Lines 23-24: Flawed logic
if (!problem.OriginalVariableCount.ToString().Contains("Integer") && 
    !problem.VariableMap.Any(v => v.OriginalType == VariableType.Integer || v.OriginalType == VariableType.Binary))
```
**Issue**: Uses string comparison on integer count instead of proper variable type checking.

#### Missing Backtracking Implementation
- No proper implementation of backtracking mechanism
- Nodes are processed in queue order without proper tree traversal
- Cannot guarantee optimal solution exploration

**Required Fix**: Complete rewrite of constraint addition logic and proper tree traversal implementation.

### 2. Cutting Plane Solver (`CuttingPlaneSolver.cs`)

**Critical Flaws**:

#### Placeholder Gomory Cut Generation
```csharp
// Lines 166-171: Random coefficient generation
for (int j = 0; j < workingProblem.TotalVariableCount; j++)
{
    cut.Coefficients[j] = Random.Shared.NextDouble() * 0.1; // Placeholder
}
```
**Issue**: Uses random values instead of computing actual Gomory cuts from tableau fractional parts.

#### Incomplete Problem Extension Logic
```csharp
// Lines 205-209: Simplified implementation note
// Update the working problem (simplified - in practice you'd need to handle objective too)
```
**Issue**: Objective function coefficients are not properly extended when adding cuts.

#### Missing Tableau Access
- No mechanism to extract tableau rows for cut generation
- Cannot compute proper fractional parts from basis inverse
- Cut generation is fundamentally broken

**Required Fix**: Complete implementation of Gomory cut generation algorithm with proper tableau analysis.

### **Detailed Problem Analysis Summary**

#### **🔍 Placeholders and Incomplete Implementations Found:**

**In SensitivityAnalysisService.cs:**
- Line 203: `return -1.5 + (variableIndex * 0.3); // Placeholder calculation`
- Line 310: `return 1.0 + (constraintIndex * 0.5); // Placeholder calculation`  
- Line 101: `// Placeholder implementation - in practice would extract from optimal tableau`

**In CuttingPlaneSolver.cs:**
- Line 169: `cut.Coefficients[j] = Random.Shared.NextDouble() * 0.1; // Placeholder`
- Line 205: `// Update the working problem (simplified - in practice you'd need to handle objective too)`

**In BranchAndBoundSimplexSolver.cs:**
- Line 372: `summaryRow.Coefficients.Add(0); // Placeholder`
- Line 262: `// This is a simplified approach - in practice you'd need to properly`

#### **🚨 Critical Missing Functionality:**

1. **Tableau Access for Sensitivity Analysis**: No mechanism to extract basis inverse or reduced costs from final tableau
2. **Proper Gomory Cut Generation**: Uses random coefficients instead of fractional part computation
3. **Branch & Bound Constraint Addition**: Placeholder logic instead of actual constraint matrix extension
4. **Shadow Price Calculation**: All shadow prices are computed using dummy formulas
5. **Complementary Slackness Verification**: Simplified checks instead of proper dual solution validation

### 3. Branch & Bound Knapsack Solver (`BranchAndBoundKnapsackSolver.cs`)

**Limitations**:
- Only works for single-constraint binary knapsack problems
- Cannot handle multiple constraints as required by project
- Limited to maximization problems only
- No support for mixed integer variables

### 4. Sensitivity Analysis Service (`SensitivityAnalysisService.cs`)

**Major Gaps**:

#### Placeholder Calculations Throughout
```csharp
// Lines 202-204: Dummy reduced cost calculation
return -1.5 + (variableIndex * 0.3); // Placeholder calculation

// Lines 307-310: Dummy shadow price calculation  
return 1.0 + (constraintIndex * 0.5); // Placeholder calculation
```

#### Missing Core Functionality
- No access to optimal tableau for proper sensitivity analysis
- Cannot calculate actual reduced costs or shadow prices
- Range calculations use arbitrary bounds instead of mathematical derivation
- Dual problem generation lacks proper constraint handling
